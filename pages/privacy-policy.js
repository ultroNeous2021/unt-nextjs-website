            Like most website operators, ultroNeous Technologies collects
            non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers
            and servers typically make available, such as the browser type,
            language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each
            visitor request. ultroNeous Technologies' purpose in collecting
            non-personally identifying information is to better understand how
            ultroNeous Technologies' visitors use its website. From time to
            time, ultroNeous Technologies may release non-personally-identifying
            information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends
            in the usage of its website.

          <p>
            ultroNeous Technologies also collects potentially
            personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP)
            addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on
            https://ultroneous.com/ blog posts. ultroNeous Technologies only
            discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same
            circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying
            information as described below.

          leave a comment at https://ultroneous.com/ to provide a username and
